# Problem Statement

## Overview

This project aims to build a **product recommendation system** using **collaborative filtering** techniques. The objective is to suggest relevant products to users based on their past interactions and the behavior of similar users.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains user-product interaction data with the following fields:

- **UserID**: Unique identifier for a user  
- **ProductID**: Unique identifier for a product  
- **Rating**: Numerical rating (e.g., 1 to 5) that a user has given to a product

The Data used is present in this file : [Data file](Data/raw_data.csv)

## Problem Scope

The goal is to recommend products that a user is likely to interact with or rate highly. The solution will primarily focus on **collaborative modeling**, where recommendations are driven by similarities between users and/or items based on historical data.

## Challenges and Scenarios

### 1. Cold Start - **New User Problem**
**Problem:**  
When a new user joins the system, there is no historical data to base recommendations on.

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Use **popular/trending products** as initial suggestions.
- Introduce **onboarding questions** to collect initial user preferences.
- Explore **hybrid models** combining collaborative filtering with content-based techniques (if item metadata is available).

### 2. Cold Start - **New Item Problem**
**Problem:**  
When a new product is added, no users have interacted with it, making it difficult to recommend.

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Use **item-based collaborative filtering** to identify similar items.
- Recommend new items to **active users** based on category similarity (if metadata is available).
- Gradually build item reputation through **random exposure or promotions**.




## Approach

We will explore **user-based** and **item-based collaborative filtering** techniques to generate recommendations. In future iterations, we may also consider **matrix factorization methods** and hybrid approaches to address cold-start and scalability issues.
